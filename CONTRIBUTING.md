##Disclaimer
Because this is simply a summer project, don't expect this to work in a corporate setting or for extensive projects. 
This project is monitored and administrated by a 15 yearold, so I wouldn't trust it too much.  

##Guidelines
This project is also maintaned by younger people first learning Linux and the command line in general. If you would like to be added to the 
project, email <a href="mailto:lucas.burlingham@icloud.com">Lucas Burlingham</a> for more information.
